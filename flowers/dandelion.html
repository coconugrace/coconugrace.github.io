<p>I would be surprised if you haven’t heard of the dandelion before. The dandelion is known as that pesky weed that makes its way through the air and spreads through your yard. But even dandelions have beautiful flowers. It is part of daisy family, Asteraceae. The dandelion is a generally hardy plant, and is native to Eurasia. It was likely brought to the America as a medicine, later spreading as a weed.

<p>Its name, dandelion, is a derivative for French, “Dent de Lion”, meaning “lion’s tooth”. This flower is thought to receive its name due to its jagged leaves.
Surprisingly, the dandelion is often used in medicine and food. Its leaves can be used to aid in digestion due to its abundance in vitamins like A and C. In addition, it is a great source of calcium, potassium, iron, and manganese. 
The yellow petals of this flower are mixed with a citrus to make dandelion wine. Finally, the dandelion root is an ingredient in dandelion coffee and traditional root beer.
