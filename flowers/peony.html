<p>This plant was one of my most vivid (young) childhood memories. I recall it being my favorite flower growing in our yard. Every spring, the flower would blossom great enormous flowers for a week, then fall to the ground in a heap of lush petals. Each peony season, my mom and I would rush to cut the flowers and send them to my teachers as a gift. It is surprising that this flower is not as well known as say, the rose.
  The peony is the Indianan state flower.
