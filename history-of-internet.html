<h1>The History of the Internet</h1>

<p>The internet first stemmed from war, and slowly cultivated in the University of Las Vegas. Then, in the 2000s, it exploded, attracting not only the nerdy scientific engineering people, but also the not so nerdy people. Now, anyone can find topics that relate to them, no matter their personality or interests.</p>
<p>I think in the future, things will continue to build on top of one another like coral reefs. We will figure out fancy things like virtual reality, and even more, until our inventions get so big that we either cannot handle them, or we run out of ideas of what to make (other than really expensive, luxurious things).<p>
