<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>The HTML tags are used at the very beginning and end of your code. It signals the computer that your code is written in HTML.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Head</h2>
<p>The head is located before the body, containing metadata (data about the page). Whatever is put in the head does not actually appear on the page. The head includes things like the title or style of the page.

  
<br>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>A title is used as a title over paragraphs, images, etc. The title tags go around the content you want to add weight to. A default title is bolded and enlarged.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Body</h2>
<p>The body is the place where the most of you content is placed- including headings, paragraphs, images, tables, etc.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headers are used to signify importance over other content. The header tags go around the words you want to enlargen. Headers are bigger and bolder. There are six types of headers- h1 being the biggest header, and h6 being the smallest.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Paragraph</h2>
<p>When you have a great amount of writing to include, you probably want to make it a paragraph. Paragraphs are surrounded by its paragraph tags and ae often styled.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Breaks</h2>
<p>Breaks create spaces between lines. For example, if you want to write an acrostic poem, you don't want all the letters to be squished up on one line. Breaks make adding a new line possible.</p>  
  
<br>
<h2>Lines</h2>
<p>This element is similar to a break, because is indicates a significant pause in the text. The only different is that a line runs across the page to separate the text.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>People often use comments as  personal note in their code. Comments cannot be seen on the page, but only in the code. Coders also comments to hash code out in order to debug their program.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>When coders want to redirect the user to a new place, they often use hyperlinks to do so. Hyperlinks can be placed on text or images, that when clicked, redirects to a new place on the web.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>To insert images into your website, you must paste the image link into your code. You can resize the image by setting the height and width of it within the image tag.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Lists are used to add bullet points or number your text. There are many different types of lists, including different fonts of unordered lists, as well as lists numbered by lowercase Roman numerals, uppercase Roman numerals, and Arabic numbers.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>Inserting tables are generally complicated and require more work. Every table has its start and end tag, as well as tags indicating each new row and data cell.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Blocks</h2>
<p>This element is used to divide content up and separate it into its own line (similar to using breaks). The opposite of this would be inline elements, which appear on the same line as adjacent content.</p>
