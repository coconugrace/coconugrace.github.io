<br>
<h2>Head</h2>
<p>The head is located before the body, containing metadata (data about the page). Whatever is put in the head does not actually appear on the page. The head includes things like the title or style of the page.
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;head&gt;Metadata about the page&lt;/head&gt;</p>

  
<br>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>The title is found in the head. It determines the title of the page (which the user can see on the tab at the top), as well as in the results of a search engine (such as Google) and in favorites/bookmarks.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;title&gt;Title of page&lt;/title&gt;</p>

<br>
<h2>Breaks</h2>
<p>Breaks create spaces between lines. For example, if you want to write an acrostic poem, you don't want all the letters to be squished up on one line. Breaks make adding a new line possible. Unlike paragraphs, breaks don't need an end tag.</p>  
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Lines</h2>

<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;hr&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>People often use comments as  personal note in their code. Comments cannot be seen on the page, but only in the code. Coders also comments to hash code out in order to debug their program.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- This is your comment --&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>When coders want to redirect the user to a new place, they often use hyperlinks to do so. Hyperlinks can be placed on text or images, that when clicked, redirects to a new place on the web.</p>

<p>&lt;a href="url you want to go to"&gt;the text that appears&lt;/a&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>To insert images into your website, you must paste the image link into your code. You can resize the image by setting the height and width of it within the image tag. Images also usually have alternative text that appears when the image cannot be retrieved.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;img src="image url" alt="alternative text"&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Lists are used to add bullet points or number your text. There are many different types of lists, including different fonts of unordered lists, as well as lists numbered by lowercase Roman numerals, uppercase Roman numerals, and Arabic numbers. Lists can be as long as you want (of course don't try to crash your computer though).</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<h5>Ordered list:</h5>
<p>&lt;ol&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 1&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 2&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;content of bullet 3&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<h5>Unordered list:</h5>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 1&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 2&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;content of bullet 3&lt;/li&gt;</p>
  
<br>

<h4>Syntax</h4>
  
<br>
<h2>Blocks</h2>
<p>This element is used to divide content up and separate it into its own line (similar to using breaks). The opposite of this would be inline elements, which appear on the same line as adjacent content.</p>
