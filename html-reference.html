<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>People often use comments as  personal note in their code. Comments cannot be seen on the page, but only in the code. Coders also comments to hash code out in order to debug their program.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- This is your comment --&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>When coders want to redirect the user to a new place, they often use hyperlinks to do so. Hyperlinks can be placed on text or images, that when clicked, redirects to a new place on the web.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;a href="url you want to go to"&gt;the text that appears&lt;/a&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>To insert images into your website, you must paste the image link into your code. You can resize the image by setting the height and width of it within the image tag. Images also usually have alternative text that appears when the image cannot be retrieved.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>&lt;img src="image url" alt="alternative text"&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Lists are used to add bullet points or number your text. There are many different types of lists, including different fonts of unordered lists, as well as lists numbered by lowercase Roman numerals, uppercase Roman numerals, and Arabic numbers. Lists can be as long as you want (of course don't try to crash your computer though).</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<h5>Ordered list:</h5>
<p>&lt;ol&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 1&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 2&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;content of bullet 3&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<h5>Unordered list:</h5>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 1&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;content of bullet 2&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;content of bullet 3&lt;/li&gt;</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>Inserting tables are generally complicated and require more work. Every table has its start and end tag, as well as tags indicating each new row and data cell.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
  
<br>
<h2>Blocks</h2>
<p>This element is used to divide content up and separate it into its own line (similar to using breaks). The opposite of this would be inline elements, which appear on the same line as adjacent content.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
